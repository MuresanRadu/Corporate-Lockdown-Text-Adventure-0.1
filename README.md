# Corporate-Lockdown-Text-Adventure-0.1
## Simple Text Adventure Engine.

This is a proof of concept for a small console based pick your own adventure game.

The bones of the project are done and they are scalable from here.

You can:
- Create different layouts for the rooms
- Place different objects in the rooms
- Create a story
- Place doors/rooms manually or opt for a pure rng roguelike type generation for the rooms and objects
